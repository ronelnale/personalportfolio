      <h3>Hello I'm Ronel B 19 years old and currently 2nd year Information Technology student at University of Science and Technology of Southern Philippines. I love playing video games, watching anime/k-drama, and travelling. I already have experience making a online game but private server which means reimplementation in online games servers, typically as clones of proprietary commercial software by a third party of the game community but we spend money to buy those files and rework it in our own specially anti ddos use to block all attack from other server and my last server was december and planning to have another private server next month march with my team, In this way i can earn money specially if the server crowded.<span> #SinglegapangitadiayUwU</span> </h3>
